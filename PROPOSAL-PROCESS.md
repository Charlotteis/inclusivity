For a project-wide/organization-wide proposals, a PR should be opened in either
the main `nodejs/node` repository or the `nodejs/TSC` repository and the
`@nodejs/tsc` should be mentioned. 

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The Node.js Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. In other words, the TSC can not mandate existing working groups
alter their charters. In that situation, the TSC will have to decide if they
will accept an individual working group's decision or if they will instead
revoke the group's charter.
